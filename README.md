# Machine Learning Systems

This repository contains end-to-end machine learning systems focused on real-world tabular and structured data problems.

## What This Repo Demonstrates
- Problem formulation from business or operational objectives
- Feature engineering pipelines
- Leakage-aware validation strategies
- Model comparison and selection
- Metric alignment with real-world impact
- Deployment-ready inference pipelines

## Included Projects
- churn-risk-prediction-system  
- credit-default-prediction-system  
- fraud-detection-pipeline  

## Core Focus Areas
- Robust data preprocessing
- Interpretable and non-interpretable models
- Trade-offs between performance and complexity
- Practical evaluation under realistic constraints

## How to Navigate
Each folder represents a complete machine learning system.
All projects follow a consistent and reproducible structure.
